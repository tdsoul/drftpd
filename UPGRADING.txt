## UPGRADING

To upgrade from 3.x to 4.0.0-beta1 you will not be able to keep the virtual file system
or slave files. Userfiles will be converted correctly if password is not encrypted.

Follow the installation documentation and do now install into the version 4.x:

https://github.com/drftpd-ng/drftpd/blob/master/README.md

Next if you have user files that predate 4.0.0-beta1, they need to be converted. There is a script in "TODO"
that is called "TODO: Migrate-v3-to-v4.sh". Next start the master and readd slaves.
Themes and all .conf files have to be rebuild in 4.0.0-beta1. Copying over the files will
give you alot of problems. The virtual file system will be built when slaves are
merged for the first time.

## To upgrade from 4.x to the latest:

Before performing a upgrade of drftpd, make sure to delete the following folders:
- src

### Compile
- Run mvn clean
- Run mvn validate
- Run mvn install

Regarding the configuration files, check that you are using the new ones once the build is done.
